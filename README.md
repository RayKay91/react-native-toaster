# react-native-toaster

A toast notification library for react native apps. It works on a queue system ensuring toasts aren't lost and can be displayed one after the other rather than taking up lots of space on screen.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-toaster
```

## Usage

Details to come when I actually finish this lol.
